              Drag your application documents to this window to upload them, or use the file picker below. 
              You can upload multiple files at once if your browser supports it. We prefer documents in <strong>
              PDF</strong> format, and ideally not more than 4 pages total. We will also accept files in
              .docx, .doc, or .rtf formats.

              After you have uploaded your resume, cover letter, and any other material you feel 
              is necessary to your application, click the <span class="label label-success">Submit Application</span>
              button. <strong>You will not be able to make changes to your application after you have submitted 
              it.</strong>
